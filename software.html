							<p>Intralattice is a plugin for Grasshopper used to generate solid lattice structures within a 3D design space. It was developed as an extensible, open-source alternative to current commercial solutions. As an ongoing project developed at McGill’s Additive Design & Manufacturing Laboratory (ADML), it has been a valuable research tool, serving as a platform for breakthroughs in multi-scale design and optimization. By giving you full access to the source, we hope to collectively explore lattice design at a deeper level, and consequently, engineer better products.</p>

							<p>The rise of additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) has allowed engineers to integrate new orders of complexity into their designs. In that regard, this software generates lattice structures as a means to:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Reduce volume/weight while maintaining structural integrity.</li>
								<li>Increase surface area as a means of maximizing heat transfer.</li>
								<li>Generate porosity in bone scaffolds and implants.</li>
								<li>Serve as a platform for structural optimization..</li>

							<p>SimuLattice is a MATLAB based software to support the simulaion-based design of lattice structure. Previous simulation models for lattice structure is either computational heavy or lack of accuracy. The proposed simulation scheme in SimuLattice has three simulation models that can be used in three design stages. It can help designers quickly and accurately get the mechanical property of lattice structures fabricated by additive manufacturing.</p>

							<p>The design of lattice structures can be divided into three design stages. In each stage, a simulation model is proposed. Furthermore, a material model is established in SimuLattice to consider the manufacturing influence of AM. There are totally four modules in SimuLattice:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Numerical homogenization models for initial design.</li>
								<li>Joint stiffening element model for design optimization.</li>
								<li>Hybrid element model for design validation.</li>
								<li>As-built material property model.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>ConsolidDesign is a plugin for Rhinoceros to support the identification and redesign of parts candidate for consolidation, which is specifically driven by the extremely expanded design freedoms of additive manufacturing. The design helps designers to semi-automatically identify part candidacy out of a complex product and guides them through the embodiment design step by step. </p>

							<p>The functionality offered by this tool include:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Interactive tool for establishing DSM-like part function interaction map.</li>
								<li>Automated identification of part candidates for consolidation.</li>
								<li>Guided steps for fusing the assembly into one single design space in preparation for structure optimization.</li>
